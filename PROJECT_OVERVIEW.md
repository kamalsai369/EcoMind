- **Reactive rather than proactive** - Problems are often detected after significant damage has occurred
- **Expensive** - Requiring specialized equipment and trained personnel
- **Inconsistent** - Different methodologies lead to varying data quality

### The Critical Need
With over **10 million hectares of forest lost annually** worldwide, there's an urgent need for:
1. **Real-time monitoring** of forest health indicators
2. **Early detection** of potential threats and anomalies
3. **Predictive analytics** to forecast future forest conditions
4. **Accessible data visualization** for stakeholders and decision-makers
5. **Scalable solutions** that can monitor vast forest areas efficiently
